				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Something that I wanted to gain out of this experiment was to just generally have more experience with grammars. I've used them before, but keeping my skills fresh is always a good thing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>What I did here was make a base blueprint for my text to use and then put in placeholders for spaces to be filled in with grammars. I also pointed some grammars at each other for the small chance that words would show up from the other lists.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I found the actual writing and trying to come up with the different randomized options to be very tedious, but I had a lot fo fun with the rest of it! This kind of skill is always good to go back to as something in your back pocket when working in other projects.</p>
